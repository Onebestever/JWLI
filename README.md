### How It’s made

This JWLI website is also another mock up. It’s layout is 1 of the most commonly used for websites. I really enjoy the clean look of this page. Everything that is important strands out and it’s just so easy to navigate and read through due to the padding & margin. The media queries were also great . I really enjoyed playing around with the margins and padding. Creating distances within the elements using padding and around them using margin. 

** Langs used **
HTML & CSS
### optimizations
The Main picture in The Who are we didn’t size down though & when I have  some time I will figure out why that is


### Lessons Learned
The two properties “padding and margin” are so important  because it creates the perfect alignment and structuring of spaces within the document. Floats are another great strategy to use to get containers / sections moved to where you want them.
